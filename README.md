 US Candy Sales Performance Optimization with Tableau

Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze the sales performance of candy products in the US, focusing on factory-to-customer shipping routes, product margins, and identifying opportunities to optimize logistics and factory placement.

The project addresses several key business questions
What are the most efficient and least efficient factory-to-customer shipping routes?
Which product lines yield the highest profit margins?
Which product lines could be moved to different factories to optimize shipping routes?

Key Insights and Findings:
Efficient Shipping Routes:The Secret Factory is the most efficient in terms of distance and profit per km, with an average delivery distance of 34.35 km and generating $0.58 profit per km.

Least Efficient Shipping Routes:The Other Factory performs poorly, with an average delivery distance of 35.15 km, but only generating $0.04 profit per km.

Best Product Margins:The Wonka Bar - Scrumdiddlyumptious has the highest margin, generating $19,368 profit.

Factory Optimization Recommendations:Based on the analysis, it was recommended not to move five high-margin products, as both Lot’s O’ Nuts & Wicked Choccy’s Factory could serve the same markets. By producing these products in both factories, 84,000 km of delivery distance can be saved.

Tools:Tableau Desktop for data visualization.

Techniques:
Data analysis and visualization using Tableau (e.g., calculated fields, aggregations, parameter-driven filtering).
Geographic mapping of factory-to-customer shipping routes.
Profit margin analysis and comparison.
Optimization strategy for factory and product re-routing.

Conclusion
The project successfully identified opportunities to optimize shipping routes, recommended factory changes to reduce delivery distance, and highlighted the most profitable products, ultimately improving operational efficiency and profitability.
